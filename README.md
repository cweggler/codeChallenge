# codeChallenge
This is an app I created for a code challenge.

To run it please clone the repo by going up to the upper right and clicking on the green Clone or download button,
then copy that link

Open the terminal on your computer 

Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

then type "git clone" and paste the url and press enter

Open that cloned repository folder to run in Android Studio
